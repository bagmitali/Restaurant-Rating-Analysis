* Title :-  **Restaurant Ratings Analysis**
* Tool used:- MS SQL and PowerBi

 # Introduction :- 
- In this project, analysed restaurant ratings data to evaluate the performance of various restaurants.
- Used SQL to extract, clean, and analyze the data, identifying key trends and insights.
- I explored the relationship between factors such as location, cuisine type, and price range with restaurant ratings.
- I visualized the results in Power BI to present clear insights and highlight patterns in the data for better decision-making.

# Data :- 
- This dataset is from Maven Analytics. Restaurant ratings in Mexico by real consumers from 2012 with 5 CSV Files.
- Customer Details: The table contains customer information- Consumer_ID,	City,	State,	Country,	Latitude,	Longitude,	Smoker,	Drink_Level,	Transportation_Method,	Marital_Status,	Children,	Age,	Occupation	Budget

- Customer Ratings: This dataset is the main table in the project. It includes information regarding customer ratings - Consumer_ID,	Restaurant_ID,	Overall_Rating,	Food_Rating,	Service_Rating

  # Approach :
- Acquired the restaurant ratings data from a publicly available source and imported it into a SQL database.
- Used SQL to clean the data and ensure that it is in a format that can be easily analyzed. This will involve tasks such as removing duplicate records, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.
- Use SQL to extract relevant information from the data, such as the average rating for each restaurant, the number of reviews, and the location of the restaurant.
- Analyzed the datasets using advanced SQL and used PowerBi to visualise the insights.

# SQL Functions Used :
